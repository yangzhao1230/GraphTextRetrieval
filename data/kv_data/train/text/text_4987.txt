it has been investigated for the treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer. it is a novel pyrrolopyrimidine derivative, and an orally available inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT (protein kinase B) with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits all AKT isoforms. Inhibition of AKT prevents the phosphorylation of AKT substrates that mediate cellular processes, such as cell division, apoptosis, and glucose and fatty acid metabolism. A wide range of solid and hematological malignancies show dysregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling due to mutations in multiple signaling components. By targeting AKT, the key node in the PIK3/AKT signaling network, this agent may be used as monotherapy or combination therapy for a variety of human cancers.
